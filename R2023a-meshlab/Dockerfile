# MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) v9.14 (R2023a)   
#   
# This docker file will configure an environment into which the Matlab compiler
# runtime will be installed and in which stand-alone matlab routines (such as
# those created with MATLAB's deploytool) can be executed.   

# MATLAB Runtime   
# Run compiled MATLAB applications or components without installing MATLAB   
# The MATLAB Runtime is a standalone set of shared libraries that enables the   
# execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components. When used together,
# MATLAB, MATLAB Compiler, and the MATLAB Runtime enable you to create and distribute  
# numerical applications or software components quickly and securely.   
#
# See https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html for more info. 
#
# MeshLab  
# the open source system for processing and editing 3D triangular meshes. 
# It provides a set of tools for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering,   
# texturing and converting meshes.  It offers features for processing raw data produced by   
# 3D digitization tools/devices and for preparing models for 3D printing.
